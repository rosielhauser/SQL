#In this final SQL project, I've worked with a dataset called Chinook which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
#I then used the information from the tables within the database to answer more advanced questions about the data.
#This link shows a visual layout of the type of data within the database and how each table is related: https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/sqlite-sample-database-color.jpg
