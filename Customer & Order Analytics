--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.--

ORDER BY price asc LIMIT 1;
--OR--
SELECT distinct product, price

ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?-- (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products)
SELECT distinct product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?--
SELECT product, sum(quantity), sum(quantity)*price as revenue

WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?--
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum) as 'Feb customers', avg(quantity)*price as 'average spent'
