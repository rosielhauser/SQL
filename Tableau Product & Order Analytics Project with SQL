--In this project, I've taken information from a database and queried it using SQL in order to create visualizations with it in Tableau.
--The link to the final Tableau project can be found here:

--1.Write SQL that will give: The account numbers, the count of order IDs, product, quantity, price, order date, and location for all orders that were placed in February.--
SELECT cust.acctnum, COUNT(cust.order_id) as Orders
,feb.product
,feb.quantity
,feb.price
,feb.orderdate
,feb.location 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id

GROUP BY
cust.acctnum
,feb.product
,feb.quantity
,feb.price
,feb.orderdate
,feb.location;
