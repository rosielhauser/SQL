-- In this project, I've downloaded a dataset containing Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then, I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata
(id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csc into the table.

--Next, I explored the datas using the following SQL.

--First, I determined the average popularity, danceability and energy by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;


--Then , I determined who the Top 10 artists were by popularity.
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--Then, I determined what artist released the longest song.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms as duration
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration desc
LIMIT 1;

--Then, I determined the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs.
SELECT track_name, avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--Lastly, I've calculated the average popularity for the artists in the table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, I've shown their name, average popularity, and labeled them as a "Top Star".
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name, avg(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity >= 90;
